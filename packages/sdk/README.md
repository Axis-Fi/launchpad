# TODO

1. Remove cloak and env copies from the dapp folder, use the packages/ versions instead
2. Cache analysis, reduce RPC calls, review batch settings etc.
3. Add docs folder, autogenerate docs from tsdoc comments
4. Create README.md
5. Test using various wallet types (MM/Frame/WalletConnect/Safe etc.) (see what we can automate)
6. Add examples to tsdoc comments
7. TBD: Move sdk out of packages and into its own repo so we can release it indepedently of the rest of the frontend
8. Determine if it makes sense to include a wagmi/etheres adapter
9. Check for any TODO comments left in the codebase
10. Licensing - figure out which license to give SDK, other frontend packages and main dapp
